Text Classification Using Naive Bayes
Naive bayes (Naive - independent , bayes - predict the probability of event )
3 types : 
         1. Binary
         2. Multinomial
         3. Gaussian 
Reason why we choose only multinomial for text classification b/c as multi represent the freq of each word so as in text classification result depends on the freq of each words that's we use this multinomial as one of them naive bayes

In this project Multinomial Naive Bayes(sklearn's MultinomialNB as well as Multinomial Naive Bayes implemented from scratch) has been used for text classification using python 3. 
Dataset available at - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty+Newsgroups 
Given a text document we aim to predict the news group category (out of the the 20 given categories) it belongs to.
